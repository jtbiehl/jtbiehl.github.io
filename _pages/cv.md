  * <i>Created LocoVisit</i>. Towards a vision of self-service workplaces, LocoVisit is a smartphone application and related cloud services that automate check-in and routing of corporate visitors.  Powered by our indoor location framework, LocoVisit monitors the movement and activities of visitors and their hosts.  The application provides real-time schedule updates, notifications to relevant parties, and real-time routing to meeting locations.  The service also provides corporate security functions, alerting stakeholders when visitors enter spaces not approved for access. 
  * <i>Co-created LocoJourney with Fuji Xerox business development team.</i> Working with a major US health care provider, we developed a smartphone application and related cloud services that track patient movement in a women’s health clinic.  The application assists in routing patients to correct locations and provides health care workers with awareness of patient progress and wait time. Care providers and patients are also linking through direct communication tools within the app. The application produces long-term statistics on patient flow and client performance. 
  * <i>Created Loco and LocoSecure, a trusted location sensing framework.</i> The Loco Framework utilizes common BLE beacons and machine learning classification techniques to provide highly-accurate indoor positioning on everyday devices (e.g. iPhone, Android devices).  Further, cryptographic techniques are incorporated to prevent device and application level spoofing of location.  This enables more secure application use cases that can’t be supported by standard BLE beacon deployments.  The Loco technology is currently deployed as a customer trial with a Fuji Xerox customer in the global banking sector.
  * <i>Created Jarvis, a Robotic Telepresence Device for supporting small group creative work.</i> This device, designed to be placed at a small work table, allows a single remote worker to participate in small team meetings.  Evaluations comparing the use of Jarvis to traditional telepresence tools (e.g. Skype) show Jarvis creates a more balanced interaction across remote and local workers. The current prototype of Jarvis is on display at the Fuji Xerox Innovation Center in Singapore and at the Fuji Xerox R&D Square, Yokohama, Japan.
  * <i>Created MyUnity, a workplace awareness framework.</i> MyUnity is a workplace tool to assist workers in finding and communicating with colleagues.  It provides presence information and availability across several different communication paths, both virtual and physical. MyUnity employs as a host of in-environment sensors, applications, and network-level monitoring, to summarize communication state of an employee and provides recommendations for channels of, and time for communication.

* <b>Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois</b>  
   Research Assistant (August 2004 – July 2008)  
   Computer Human Interaction Design Group (ORCHID)
   
  * <i>Created a new interaction framework to support collaboration in multi-device environments.</i> The framework, IMPROMPTU, supports natural and effective use of digital information artifacts when collaborating within MDEs. Features of the framework include the ability to share a variety of task information across devices via off-the-shelf applications, to enable joint interaction with information for focused problem solving, and to allow different users to place information on shared displays for joint reflection and discussion. The framework was developed using a user-centered design process that included leveraging lessons learned from my prior MDE work, applying known principles of group-work theory, and incorporating user feedback gained through a series of surveys, interviews, and iterative prototyping. 
  * <i>Studied how software developers utilize multi-device environments and supporting software to perform their work.</i> Designed and executed a field study with software developers in a major, U.S.-based software company. This study was one of the first to look at multi-device environment use in an authentic setting.  The study contributed one of the first evidence-based understandings of how MDEs are used in practice and provided lessons to guide the design of future MDE collaborative software.
  * <i>Designed and evaluated new interaction metaphors for managing information artifacts in multi-device environments.</i> Designed and implemented two new interfaces that utilize a world-in-miniature metaphor. These interfaces, SEAPort and ARIS, enable users to leverage their spatial reasoning abilities when organizing information across devices. Laboratory studies comparing these interfaces against existing interfaces showed users were able to complete management tasks faster and with fewer errors. Our world-in-minute metaphor has influenced other research projects investigating the collaborative use of multiple displays.
  * <i>Developed new and adapted methods for low-fidelity prototyping in multi-device environments.</i> Worked to develop practices for creating and evaluating low-fidelity prototypes for multi-device environments. New techniques can be used to produce higher quality prototypes and lead to better evaluation results.

* <b>Microsoft Research</b>  
   Research Intern (Summer 2006)  
   Visualization and Interaction for Business and Entertainment Research Group (VIBE)

   <i>Created a new visualization for acquiring and maintaining workspace awareness for software teams.</i> The new visualization and supporting infrastructure, called FASTDash, allows developers to quickly and easily understand where activity is occurring in the shared software code base, what that activity is, and who is performing that activity. A field study was performed which showed FASTDash increased project-related communication, improved aspects of workspace awareness, and reduced reliance on other methods for acquiring and maintaining awareness.

* <b>National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA)</b>  
   Research Assistant (Summer 2003)  
   Automated Learning Group

   <i>Developed and implemented interface and interaction techniques in REVEAL</i>, a system for visually exploring search results. I was responsible for performing a formal evaluation of the interface using standard metrics of interface evaluation.  Evaluation was used to make usability modifications to the system’s design.
