Work experience
======
* FX Palo Alto Laboratory, Inc. (FXPAL)
   Research Scientist (August 2008 – April 2013)
   Senior Research Scientist (April 2013 – April 2019)
   Principal Research Scientist (April 2019 - June 2019)
   Leader, Ambient Computing Research Group (April 2014 – June 219)
   
  * Created LocoVisit. Towards a vision of self-service workplaces, LocoVisit is a smartphone application and related cloud services that automate check-in and routing of corporate visitors.  Powered by our indoor location framework, LocoVisit monitors the movement and activities of visitors and their hosts.  The application provides real-time schedule updates, notifications to relevant parties, and real-time routing to meeting locations.  The service also provides corporate security functions, alerting stakeholders when visitors enter spaces not approved for access. 
  * Co-created LocoJourney with Fuji Xerox business development team. Working with a major US health care provider, we developed a smartphone application and related cloud services that track patient movement in a women’s health clinic.  The application assists in routing patients to correct locations and provides health care workers with awareness of patient progress and wait time. Care providers and patients are also linking through direct communication tools within the app. The application produces long-term statistics on patient flow and client performance. 
  * Created Loco and LocoSecure, a trusted location sensing framework. The Loco Framework utilizes common BLE beacons and machine learning classification techniques to provide highly-accurate indoor positioning on everyday devices (e.g. iPhone, Android devices).  Further, cryptographic techniques are incorporated to prevent device and application level spoofing of location.  This enables more secure application use cases that can’t be supported by standard BLE beacon deployments.  The Loco technology is currently deployed as a customer trial with a Fuji Xerox customer in the global banking sector.
  * Created Jarvis, a Robotic Telepresence Device for supporting small group creative work. This device, designed to be placed at a small work table, allows a single remote worker to participate in small team meetings.  Evaluations comparing the use of Jarvis to traditional telepresence tools (e.g. Skype) show Jarvis creates a more balanced interaction across remote and local workers. The current prototype of Jarvis is on display at the Fuji Xerox Innovation Center in Singapore and at the Fuji Xerox R&D Square, Yokohama, Japan.
  * Created MyUnity, a workplace awareness framework. MyUnity is a workplace tool to assist workers in finding and communicating with colleagues.  It provides presence information and availability across several different communication paths, both virtual and physical. MyUnity employs as a host of in-environment sensors, applications, and network-level monitoring, to summarize communication state of an employee and provides recommendations for channels of, and time for communication.
