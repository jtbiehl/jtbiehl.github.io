By enabling users to better manage information across PDAs, laptops, graphics tablets, and large screens, the use of an interactive space could dramatically improve how users share information in collaborative work. To enable a user to better manage information in an interactive space, we iteratively designed an interactive space window manager called ARIS. We discuss the implementation of ARIS and we share lessons learned from user evaluations about how to design a more effective window manager for an interactive space and how to better evaluate low-fidelity prototypes in an interactive space. Our work can enable richer collaborations among users of an interactive space.
