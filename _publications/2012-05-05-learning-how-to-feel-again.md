title: "Learning How to Feel Again: Towards Affective Workplace Presence and Communication Technologies"
collection: publications
excerpt: "Reports on a system that attempts to learn affective state to inform co-workers of colleagues' affective state.  Results from an evaluation of the technology's deployment show it to be more effective than a baseline of colleague assessment."

Affect influences workplace collaboration and thereby impacts a workplace's productivity. Participants in face-to-face interactions have many cues to each other's affect, but work is increasingly carried out via computer-mediated channels that lack many of these cues. Current presence systems enable users to estimate the availability of other users, but not their affective states or communication preferences. This work demonstrates the feasibility of estimating affective state and communication preferences from a stream of presence states that are already being shared in a deployed presence system.
