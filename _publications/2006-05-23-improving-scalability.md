Iconic interfaces offer a promising interaction metaphor for effectively managing applications in multi-device environments. However, current implementations scale poorly for even a modest number of applications and do not allow users to maintain adequate awareness of the workspace. To overcome these limitations, we have designed new interaction techniques and prototyped them within a new iconic interface. Our interface uses zooming and animation-based interactions to improve scalability and uses application icons and portal views with real-time updates to enhance awareness. Results from a user study confirm the efficacy of these techniques. These techniques can be used to improve the broader class of iconic and portal-based interfaces.
