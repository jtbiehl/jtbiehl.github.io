excerpt: 'Reliable location estimation has been a key enabler of many applications in the UbiComp space. Much progress has been madeon the development of accurate of indoor location systems, which form the foundation of many interesting applications,particularly in consumer scenarios. However, many location-based applications in enterprise settings also require addressinganother facet of reliability: assurance. Without having strong guarantees of a location estimate’s legitimacy, stakeholders mustexplicitly balance the advantages offered with the risks of falsification. In this space, there are two key threats: replay attacks,where signal and sensor information is collected in one location and replayed in another to falsify a location estimation later intime; and wormhole attacks, where signal and sensor information is forwarded to a remote location by a colluding device tofalsify location estimation in real-time. In this work, we improve upon the state of the art in wormhole-resistant locationestimation techniques. Specifically, we present the Location Anchor, which leverages a combination of technical solutions andsocial contracts to provide high-assurance proofs of device location that are resistant to wormhole attacks. Unlike existing work,the Location Anchor has minimal hardware costs, supports a rich tapestry of applications, and is compatible with commoditysmartphone and tablet platforms. We show that the Location Anchor can extend existing replay-resistant location systems intowormhole-resistant location systems, even in the face of very aggressive attacker assumptions. We describe the protocolsunderlying the Location Anchor, as well as report on the efficacy of a prototype implementation.'
